# Chatroom
This is a chatroom website inspired by Discord and other common web-based chatrooms that I made for my NEA Project for my last year of computer science in college (UK) - 04/21
Repository includes all  the files and a document detailing the process of the project

NOTE - The chatlog refresh is bugged as it constantly refreshes and scrolls down meaning users cannot see past messages
